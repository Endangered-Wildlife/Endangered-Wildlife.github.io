It covers everything from indentation to naming conventions, ensuring consistent code structure. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Use 4 spaces per indentation level.</li> <li>Limit lines to 79 characters.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Use Meaningful Variable and Function Names:</p> </li> <li>Choose descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable or function.</li> <li> <p>Example: Use <code>calculate_total_cost()</code> instead of <code>calc()</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Write Modular Code:</p> </li> <li> <p>Break down large tasks into smaller, reusable functions. This makes your code more organized and easier to test.</p> </li> <li> <p>Document Your Code:</p> </li> <li> <p>Use comments and docstrings to explain why certain decisions were made or what a function is supposed to do. This helps other developers (and your future self) understand the code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keep Functions and Classes Simple:</p> </li> <li> <p>Follow the single responsibility principle: each function or class should have one purpose. Complex functions are harder to understand and maintain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoid Hardcoding:</p> </li> <li> <p>Use constants, configuration files, or environment variables to make your code adaptable to different contexts or environments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Handle Errors Gracefully:</p> </li> <li> <p>Use exceptions to manage errors in a way that doesn\u2019t crash the program. Provide clear error messages when something goes wrong.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optimize for Readability Over Cleverness:</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoid writing overly complex or tricky code. Opt for readability, even if the code looks simpler or less \"sophisticated.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Use List Comprehensions (But Not Excessively):</p> </li> <li> <p>Python\u2019s list comprehensions are concise and readable, but avoid nesting too deeply. Use them when they improve readability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consistent Naming Conventions:</p> <ul> <li>Follow conventions like:</li> <li><code>snake_case</code> for variables and function names.</li> <li><code>CamelCase</code> for classes.</li> <li><code>_</code> prefix for private variables or functions.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>By adhering to these principles, you'll write Python code that's not only clear to you but also easy for others to read and maintain.</p> <p>Yes, apart from SOLID principles, there are several other design principles and methodologies used to improve software architecture and maintainability. Here are a few prominent ones:</p>"},{"location":"clear/#1-dry-dont-repeat-yourself","title":"1. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself","text":"<p>This principle suggests that you should avoid duplicating code. Instead of repeating code in multiple places, abstract the common functionality into a single location (function, class, or module).</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>def calculate_tax(price):\n    return price * 0.2\n\ndef print_receipt(price):\n    total_price = price + calculate_tax(price)\n    print(f\"Price: {price}, Total (with tax): {total_price}\")\n</code></pre> <p>Here, the <code>calculate_tax()</code> function is reused wherever tax calculation is needed, avoiding code repetition.</p>"},{"location":"clear/#2-kiss-keep-it-simple-stupid","title":"2. KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid","text":"<p>This principle emphasizes simplicity in design. The idea is to write code that is as simple as possible while still achieving the required functionality. Over-complicated designs and solutions should be avoided.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>def find_max(numbers):\n    return max(numbers)\n</code></pre> <p>A simple, straightforward function that uses built-in functionality, rather than reinventing the wheel.</p>"},{"location":"clear/#3-yagni-you-arent-gonna-need-it","title":"3. YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It","text":"<p>This principle advises against writing code for functionality that is not required right now.
