**1. Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF):**
The GBIF API provides access to billions of records about species occurrences, distributions, and traits from thousands of data publishers worldwide. This is an excellent source for obtaining basic species data.

**2. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species:**
The IUCN Red List is a comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of plant and animal species. It includes data on population trends, threats, and conservation actions for endangered species.

**3. Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS):**
ITIS is a database of standardized scientific and common names for species, with classifications, notes, and cross-references. It's useful for taxonomic information and validating species names.

**4. VertNet, FishNet2, MaNIS, HerpNET, ORNIS:**
These are biodiversity data portals that aggregate species occurrence data from natural history museums and other institutions, focusing on specific taxonomic groups like vertebrates, fish, mammals, herps, and birds.

**5. DataONE:**
DataONE is a repository of ecological and environmental datasets, including many related to species and biodiversity. You can search for and access a wide range of species-focused datasets.

**6. Database tools:**
- For storing and managing species data, consider using a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Elasticsearch.
- Visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly can help analyze and plot species population trends, conservation status, and other metrics over time.
- Modeling and analysis tools like R, Python, and GIS software can be used for more advanced population viability analysis, species distribution modeling, and interaction matrix development.

**7. Citizen science platforms:**
Platforms like iNaturalist, eBird, and PlantNet allow the public to contribute observations of species, which can supplement official datasets.

1.	Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF): GBIF is excellent for large-scale biodiversity data, especially for species occurrence records, geographic distribution, and taxonomy. You can use the GBIF API to access data on species observations, specimen collections, and checklists.
2.	Encyclopedia of Life (EOL): EOL has extensive species descriptions, habitat information, conservation status, and multimedia resources. Their API offers access to species data and taxonomic hierarchy, which can help with species interaction and habitat mapping.
3.	iNaturalist: This citizen science platform is rich in observational data and time series data for species occurrences, allowing insights into population changes over time. You can use the iNaturalist API for real-time species sightings.
4.	Atlas of Living Australia (ALA): The ALA provides a vast amount of biodiversity data, including species interactions, habitat, and ecosystem data. Itâ€™s particularly strong for Australian biodiversity but connects with other global datasets. The ALA API allows access to occurrence records, taxonomy, and species interactions.
5.	Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL): BHL archives historical biodiversity literature and can be valuable for legacy species data and historical population data. They offer an API for accessing publications and species descriptions.
6.	National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy and GenBank: For more genetic and taxonomy-focused data, NCBI has species records and genetic sequence data. The NCBI Taxonomy API could complement ecological data with phylogenetic information.
7.	Map of Life (MoL): MoL provides data on species distribution, ranges, and environmental interactions. This data can be useful for identifying regional data and understanding the habitat preferences of species.



## APIs
### GBIF

Here are some of the key GBIF API endpoints that may be useful for accessing species data:

```json
{
  "occurrences": "/v1/occurrence/search",
  "species": "/v1/species/search",
  "speciesById": "/v1/species/{speciesKey}",
  "datasets": "/v1/dataset/search",
  "datasetsByKey": "/v1/dataset/{datasetKey}",
  "homepageFacts": "/v1/dashboard/facts",
  "metrics": "/v1/metrics/occurrence",
  "downloads": "/v1/occurrence/download/request",
  "downloadStatus": "/v1/occurrence/download/{downloadKey}"
}

```

Here's a brief overview of how you can use these endpoints:

1. **Occurrences**: The `/v1/occurrence/search` endpoint allows you to search for and retrieve species occurrence records, including location, date, and other metadata.

2. **Species**: The `/v1/species/search` endpoint lets you search for species by various criteria like scientific name, common name, or taxonomy. The `/v1/species/{speciesKey}` endpoint retrieves details for a specific species.

3. **Datasets**: The `/v1/dataset/search` endpoint lists the available datasets on GBIF. The `/v1/dataset/{datasetKey}` endpoint provides more details on a specific dataset.

4. **Dashboard Facts**: The `/v1/dashboard/facts` endpoint returns high-level statistics and facts about the GBIF network.

5. **Metrics**: The `/v1/metrics/occurrence` endpoint provides aggregated metrics about the occurrence data in GBIF.

6. **Downloads**: You can use the `/v1/occurrence/download/request` endpoint to request a dataset download, and then check the status of the download using the `/v1/occurrence/download/{downloadKey}` endpoint.

This covers some of the most commonly used GBIF API endpoints for accessing species data. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
