To interact with PDFs and extract data from them using Python, there are several libraries available. Here are some of the most popular ones, along with their strengths:

### 1. **PyPDF2**
   - **Use**: Extracting text, merging, splitting, rotating, and encrypting PDFs.
   - **Installation**: `pip install PyPDF2`
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     import PyPDF2

     with open('sample.pdf', 'rb') as file:
         reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
         number_of_pages = len(reader.pages)
         first_page = reader.pages[0]
         text = first_page.extract_text()
         print(text)
     ```
   - **Strengths**: Lightweight, good for basic PDF manipulation and text extraction.

### 2. **pdfplumber**
   - **Use**: Extracting structured content like tables, images, and text.
   - **Installation**: `pip install pdfplumber`
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     import pdfplumber

     with pdfplumber.open('sample.pdf') as pdf:
         first_page = pdf.pages[0]
         text = first_page.extract_text()
         print(text)
     ```
   - **Strengths**: Excellent for extracting tables and more complex structured content.

### 3. **PyMuPDF (fitz)**
   - **Use**: Extracting text, metadata, images, and drawing shapes.
   - **Installation**: `pip install PyMuPDF`
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     import fitz  # PyMuPDF

     with fitz.open('sample.pdf') as pdf:
         first_page = pdf.load_page(0)  # 0-indexed
         text = first_page.get_text("text")
         print(text)
     ```
   - **Strengths**: Fast, supports text, images, and layout extraction.

### 4. **pdfminer.six**
   - **Use**: Detailed extraction of text and metadata, better at handling complex PDFs than PyPDF2.
   - **Installation**: `pip install pdfminer.six`
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text

     text = extract_text('sample.pdf')
     print(text)
     ```
   - **Strengths**: Great for detailed text extraction but a bit more complex to use.

### 5. **camelot-py (for tables in PDFs)**
   - **Use**: Specifically for extracting tables from PDFs.
   - **Installation**: `pip install camelot-py[cv]`
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     import camelot

     tables = camelot.read_pdf('sample.pdf')
     tables[0].to_csv('table.csv')
     ```
   - **Strengths**: Focused on table extraction, works well with PDFs that have structured table data.

### Which Library to Choose?
- **Basic Text Extraction**: Use `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber`.
- **Handling Complex PDFs with Images/Metadata**: Use `PyMuPDF` or `pdfminer.six`.
- **Extracting Tables**: Use `camelot-py` or `pdfplumber` for PDFs with tables.
