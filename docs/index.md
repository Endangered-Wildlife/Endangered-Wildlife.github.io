# Endangered Wild Life

Endangered Wildlife OÜ is developing a groundbreaking machine learning tool, the Biodiversity Valuator, designed to help
stakeholders assess the financial impact of their activities on biodiversity in accordance with European Sustainability
Reporting Standards (ESRS) E4. The project builds on an extensively peer-reviewed valuation methodology already tested
on 140 species, yet the ambitious task remains to account for over 8.9 million species globally. To advance this
mission, the company has begun constructing the necessary software infrastructure, including the Biodiversity Database,
which will integrate machine learning to source, retrieve, and analyze biodiversity data that goes beyond conventional
data scraping due to its complexity and the diverse, interconnected nature of global species data.

The project’s end goal is to transition from a consulting model to a SaaS platform, enabling clients to conduct
autonomous biodiversity valuations and supporting the broader trend of AI adoption in environmental sectors. Currently,
the company is working towards a Beta version of both the Biodiversity Database and Valuator, funded partially by grants
from the Expo Live Innovation Programme and Google for Startups Cloud Program. With a projected completion of 30 months,
the Beta will feature API-enabled data accessibility and machine learning-powered backend functionalities. Following
this stage, a SaaS release is planned, allowing users flexible subscription options and broad access to biodiversity
insights for sustainability reporting.

## Biodiversity Project

The Biodiversity Database is revolutionising biodiversity for business by bringing transparency and knowledge to the
industry. It is breaking boundaries in terms of biodiversity information availability – delivering access to regional
species level data.
